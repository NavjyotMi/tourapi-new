Welcome to the Tour API! 
    This API provides endpoints for users to register, log in, 
    manage their favorite tours, and for tour guides to add and 
    remove tours. Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access.

####Authentication####
Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

This token should be included in the Authorization header of API requests for secure access to protected endpoints.
